## We're creating an app to bridge the gap from trash bins to hungry bellies. The U.S. alone is responsible for 100 BILLION pounds of food waste every year. That's bad news for farmers, and bad news for the planet. When compost is buried in a landfill, without oxygen it becomes methane. Methane is like a blanket, trapping heat in the atmosphere. Climate Change is real, and it's really scary. RePlate takes the good stuff before it's tossed and buried, and volunteers bring it to someone who NEEDS it. No fear of litigation, very little methane, lots of good karma!
